Bhagvan Shiva is known to be the master of various dance forms. He is the author of all dance forms of the classical Indian dance (which is comprised of 108 roots of forms) and hence is called Nataraja (the king/lord of dance)
At the point of Maha-Pralaya, when creation ends and manifestation is withdrawn back into the great void. This is when Bhagwan 
Shiva releases the destructive energies to dismantle all of the creation, by performing the cosmic dance known as Rudra Tandava.
This form of Mahadeva as a cosmic dancer is known as Nataraja, symbolizing the interplay of dynamic and static divine energy flow, which contains five principles of eternal energy- creation, preservation, destruction, illusion, and emancipation. As energy can neither be created nor destroyed, the destruction initiated by Maheshwara with his cosmic dance is a medium for recreation, and the cycle never ends.

His cosmic dance in an aureole of fire, causes wild thunderstorms all around the world, and not only the earth is affected, but also the Sun, the Moon, and the stellar bodies, causing complete destruction and yet a new beginning.
Mahadeva also created 7 separate forms of Tandava known as :

Ananda Tandava
Sandhya Tandava
Kalika Tandava
Tripura Tandava
Gouri Tandav
Sanhara Tandava
Uma Tandava
