As the world is advancing toward Artificial Intelligence. We have come across so many models from MNCs like Google, OpenAI meanwhile recently China released their model and world’s first cheapest and most efficient AI model. But this AI have one main flaw and that’s the personal bias towards their country. The best example is Deepseek R1. It is managed and trained on the biased data of China. They will  never show up the data about Arunachal Pradesh or Brahmaputra. 
This AI will help us to explore the greater depths of our Sanatan culture and history with heritage and information about all the sites covering each and every data about Hinduism. 
Since considering such things we are coming up with our own AI that we are building from scratch. It will be trained on the data of all the Sanatan scriptures available till now. And we will be building it from scratch no pretrained models. 
Also, it will be visually more appealing since we are using our scriptures for that will help in restoring and gathering bhakti. In order to achieve best outcome, we need more and more people. And verification from Vedic scholars who have good knowledge of all shashtra. 
Sant of bharat, since remembering omm who gave us everything. 
Basically, Question on Hinduism. 
Since the Sanatan isn’t just a dharma but a culture. A great diversified culture consists of every ideology and philosophies from the great scholars. People often ask and have doubts about everything related to Hinduism. Our AI will work as an instant library for such things. 
This will not only reduce the gap of generations but also the gap of ideologies. People would get to everything in just one type and hitting on their keyboard. Everything on their fingertips.
